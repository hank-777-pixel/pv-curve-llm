# P-V Curve LLM

<img src="https://github.com/CURENT/andes/raw/master/docs/source/images/sponsors/CURENT_Logo_NameOnTrans.png" alt="CURENT ERC Logo" width="300" height="auto">

Using LLMs to contextualize, create, and analyze Power-Voltage Curves (Nose Curves) for Power System Voltage Stability analysis. This project experiments with AI agents and to accomplish specific tasks with natural language.

The goal of this project is to research how AI frameworks and technology can be applied to power systems, experimenting with ideas and frameworks that will eventually be applied to the CURENT LTB.

## Installation & Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Ollama installed: https://www.ollama.com/download

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run terminal as administrator
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
ollama pull mxbai-embed-large  # embedding model for RAG
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
ollama create pv-curve -f agent\Modelfile

python main.py # Run locally in terminal
# or
python server.py # Run web view
```

To leave the virtual environment, enter `deactivate`.

## Using OpenAI API (Recommended)

When running the application, you will be prompted to use 'openai' or 'ollama'. For improved performance, it is recommended to use OpenAI with an API key.

Create `agent/.env` with `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key` (get a key at the [OpenAI API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)).

## Custom vector database (RAG)

To setup a custom vector database or add to the existing database, see `agent/data/README.md` for instructions.

## File Architecture

The `agent/` directory contains the core LangGraph AI agent system with the following architecture:

**Core Entry Points:**
- `main.py` - Primary application entry point for local execution with terminal UI

**LLM Configuration & Prompts:**
- `Modelfile` - Ollama model configuration defining system behavior and example conversations. Only applies to the local model.
- `prompts.py` / `prompts_json.py` - Structured prompt templates for different agent functions. `prompts_json.py` is experimental json formatted prompts.

**Data Layer:**
- `vector_db/` - Chroma vector database storing embedded knowledge for RAG retrieval
- `data/` - Training documents in markdown format covering power system theory and PV curve concepts
- `vector.py` - Interface layer for vector database operations and similarity search
- `train.py` - Script to process training data and build/update the vector database

**Workflow Orchestration:**
- `workflows/` - LangGraph workflow definitions coordinating agent behavior
  - `compound_workflow.py` - Complex multi-step task orchestration with planning and execution
  - `simple_workflow.py` - Basic single-step task routing and execution

**Processing Nodes:**
- `nodes/` - Individual processing units that handle specific agent functions
  - `classifier_nodes.py` - Message classification (question/parameter/generation) and routing logic
  - `parameter_nodes.py` - Parameter modification, validation, and state management
  - `execution_nodes.py` - Task execution including Q&A with RAG, parameter explanations, and analysis

**Data Models:**
- `models/` - Pydantic data structures defining system state and interfaces
  - `state_models.py` - Core state management and input parameter validation
  - `plan_models.py` - Multi-step plan structures for complex task decomposition

**Domain Logic:**
- `pv_curve/` - Power system simulation engine using pandapower for IEEE test systems
  - `pv_curve.py` - Core PV curve generation with voltage stability analysis

**Support Utilities:**
- `utils/common_utils.py` - Helper functions for state management and display formatting
